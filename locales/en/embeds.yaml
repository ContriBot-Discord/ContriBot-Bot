    "ContriBot is a student project, made by [EAnathos](https://eanathos.com) &  [Voltis](https://voltis.me) at [Laval](https://maps.app.goo.gl/umYo5wYmG7eGwLWx5) in France.\n\n
    This project has been started in early October 2023, while trying to find a Discord bot that would allow us to manage our training's minecraft server community.\n\n
    Our main objective was to create a useful, fully configurable, documented and powerful Discord Bot, with all essential features free, and translated the most languages as possible.\n\n
    We've decided to develop this bot in TypeScript while using Discord.JS\n\n
    If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask it on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wMHa7XHkNj) !"
